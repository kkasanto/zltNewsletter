This is a simple Newsletter site
The purpose is to be a basic service, you can adapt and build on.

Techstack: Windows, SQL Server, ASP.NET 9, .Net Core , TinyMCE editor

There are 2 projects in here, the zltNewsletter - which forms the backend, and a sample webNewsletter which serves as a demo frontend.

Be aware, that pictures that is included in the articles are stored on the backend, see the ImageController where they land.

No user identity/security are build in this, you have to add your own to the solution.

Have fun, and let me know if it was useful.
